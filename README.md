# Analysis-of-a-Classification-model

In this question, we analyze the factors of median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 dollars' (medv). The data is stored in boston.csv collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The following describes the data set columns:
- crim - per capita rate by town
- zn - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- indus - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- chas - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- nox - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- rm - average number of rooms per dwelling
- age - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- dis - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- rad - index of accessibility to radial highways
- tax - full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars
- ptratio - pupil-teacher ratio by town
- b - 1000 ${(B_k âˆ’ 0.63)}^2$ where ${B}_{k}$ is the proportion of blacks by town
- lstat - \% lower status of the population
- medv - Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 dollars'

The goal of this problem is to use appropriate attributes in "crim, zn, indus, chas, nox, rm, age, dis, rad, tax, ptratio, b, lstat" to predict the last attribute "medv".

I finished the data clearning, visulization, modeling, classification and result analysis in the Jupyter notebook. Please go to it for details.
